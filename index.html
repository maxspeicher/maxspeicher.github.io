        <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-design/our-insights/the-business-value-of-design" target="_blank">A McKinsey study</a>
        found that companies with superior UX capabilities and customer centricity have 6.4%p higher revenue growth p.a.
        than their competitors.

        puts the ROI of good UX at 9900%.
        That's what I do.
        I make customers happy &amp; businesses successful.

        Currently, I'm Director of Product Design at Best Secret GmbH, &amp; freelance
        Strategy Advisor &amp; UX Consultant.
        I've gained extensive
        <span class="highlight-box">strategy</span> &amp;
        <span class="highlight-box">leadership</span> experience in
        <span class="highlight-box">UX</span>,
        <span class="highlight-box">research</span>, &amp;
        <span class="highlight-box">product</span>, in both academia &amp; industry, at start-ups &amp; large corporations
        alike.
        I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science for my work on search interaction optimization &amp; human-centered design
        at the R&amp;D department of Unister.
        Afterwards, I joined bitstars (now part of Faro Technologies) as a VP to work on their AR/VR platform HoloBuilder.
        During my postdoc at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, I continued working on interaction design, usability,
        &amp; AR/VR topics.
        And as the first UX Manager in C&amp;A's product management unit, I established their UX &amp; innovation practice
        from scratch.
        For my academic work, I received Best Paper awards at ACM CHI &amp; ACM EICS, where I have also regularly served as
        a reviewer.
    </p>
    <p>
        Apart from that, I love to write, about anything UX &amp; design. And poetry.
