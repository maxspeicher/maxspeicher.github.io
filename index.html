                    found that companies with superior design capabilities have 6.4%p higher revenue growth p.a. than their competitors.

                    puts the ROI of good UX at 9900%.
                    That's what I do.
                    I make users happy and businesses successful.

                    Currently, I'm Director of Product Design at BestSecret Group.
                    I've gained extensive experience in UX
                    <span class="highlight-box">strategy</span>,
                    <span class="highlight-box">leadership</span>, &amp;
                    <span class="highlight-box">management</span>, in both academia and industry, at start-ups and large corporations alike.
                    I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science for my work on search interaction optimization and human-centered design at the R&amp;D department of Unister.
                    Afterwards, I joined bitstars (now part of Faro Technologies) as a VP to work on their AR/VR platform HoloBuilder.
                    During my post-doc at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, I continued working on interaction design, usability, and AR/VR topics.
                    And as the first UX Manager in C&amp;A's eCommerce department, I established their UX and experimentation practice from scratch.
                    For my academic work, I received Best Paper awards at ACM CHI and ACM EICS, where I have also regularly served as a reviewer.

                    Apart from that, I love to write, about anything UX and design&mdash;and poetry.
