        Based on my 12+ years of experience in industry &amp; academia, at organizations of all sizes&mdash;from startups
        to large corporations&mdash;I offer freelance services around anything
        <span class="highlight-box">fractional leadership</span> &amp;
        <span class="highlight-box">consulting</span> in
        <span class="highlight-box">UX</span>,
        <span class="highlight-box">research</span> &amp;
        <span class="highlight-box">product</span>.
        As Design Director at BestSecret &amp; UX Manager at C&A, I've had the opportunity to build &amp; grow top-tier UX
        teams from scratch. Besides, I've worked as VP of Data Analytics &amp; CRO at an AR/VR startup &amp; as a researcher
        at Unister &amp; the University of Michigan. Throughout my career, I've gained extensive experience in developing
        strategies, implementing design &amp; innovation frameworks, leading &amp; growing UX teams, as well as branding
        &amp; marketing.

        On top, back in 2021, I founded
        <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/jagow-speicher/" target="_blank">Jagow Speicher</a>
        together with freelance UX Advisor
        <a href="https://www.johannajagow.com" target="_blank">Johanna Jagow</a>.
        Earlier in our careers, we built and ran C&A's eCommerce UX practice together as a two-person team. We're able to
        cover everything&mdash;from foundational research to ideation to interaction design.

        Don't know where to start with a test & learn culture?
        Looking for a usability audit of your (digital) product?
        Anything else UX-related?
        Let's talk about it.
