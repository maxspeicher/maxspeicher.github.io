        I help businesses create customer-centric digital products and achieve
        <span class="highlight-box">higher revenues</span>,
        <span class="highlight-box">more growth</span>, &amp;
        <span class="highlight-box">happier customers</span>
        through a science-based, integrated approach:
        <ol>
            <li><i>Deeply understanding customers.</i></li>
            <li><i>Solving the right problems.</i></li>
            <li><i>Continuously iterating, measuring, & learning.</i></li>
        </ol>
        I'm a director &amp; consultant with a unique background in
        <span class="highlight-box">product</span>,
        <span class="highlight-box">design thinking</span>, &amp;
        <span class="highlight-box">conversion rate optimization (CRO)</span>.
        In 12+ years, I've gained extensive experience in developing strategies (on both a product &amp; company level), implementing
        product &amp; innovation frameworks, establishing measure &amp; learn cultures, &amp; leading teams. I've worked in both,
        industry &amp; academia, from startups to large corporations.

        <!--Based on my 12+ years of experience in industry &amp; academia, at organizations of all sizes&mdash;from startups
        to large corporations&mdash;I offer freelance services around anything

        As Design Director at BestSecret &amp; UX Manager at C&A, I've had the opportunity to build &amp; grow top-tier UX
        teams from scratch. Besides, I've worked as VP of Data Analytics &amp; CRO at an AR/VR startup &amp; as a researcher

        strategies, implementing design &amp; innovation frameworks, leading &amp; growing UX teams, as well as branding
        &amp; marketing.-->

        together with freelance Senior UX Advisor

        the full scope of product management: strategy, research, ideation, validation, roadmapping, prioritization, delivery oversight, and iteration.
