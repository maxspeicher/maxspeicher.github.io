                        Based on my 12+ years of experience in industry &amp; academia, at organizations of all sizes&mdash;from startups
                        to large corporations&mdash;I offer freelance services around anything

                        <span class="highlight-box">consulting</span> in

                        As Design Director at BestSecret &amp; UX Manager at C&A, I've had the opportunity to build &amp; grow top-tier UX
                        teams from scratch. Besides, I've worked as VP of Data Analytics &amp; CRO at an AR/VR startup &amp; as a researcher
                        at Unister &amp; the University of Michigan. Throughout my career, I‚Äôve gained extensive experience in developing
                        strategies, implementing design &amp; innovation frameworks, leading &amp; growing UX teams, as well as branding
                        &amp; marketing.

                        On top, back in 2021, I founded

                        Earlier in our careers, we built and ran C&A's eCommerce UX practice together as a two-person team. We're able to
                        cover everything&mdash;from foundational research to ideation to interaction design.
